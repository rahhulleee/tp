# InsureBook User Guide



InsureBook is a **desktop app for insurance agents to manage potential and existing clients' personal and policy details.** The app has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), but most user interactions occur via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, InsureBook can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type your command into the user input box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. type **`help`** and press Enter to open the help window.<br>

Some example commands you can try:

  

*  `list` : Lists all clients.

  

*  `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 John Street m/2024-08-02 10:00` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to your InsureBook.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## Features

  

<box  type="info"  seamless>

  

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

  

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>

e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

  

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

  

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>

e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

  

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>

e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

  

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`)
will be ignored.<br>

e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

  

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span
multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

  

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous InsureBook home folder.

**Q**: What if I have two clients with the same name?<br>
**A**: You are not allowed to add clients with duplicate names into InsureBook. If you have more than 1 client with the same name, consider adding a unique identifier to their names, e.g. 'John Doe from NUS' and 'John Doe from SMU'.

**Q**: Can I leave the meeting field empty for clients that I have not scheduled a meeting with?<br>
**A**: No - the meeting field is mandatory. You WILL need to schedule appointments with your clients before adding them to the address book. We believe that requiring you to be proactive in scheduling appointments will help you reach greater heights in your career!

## Known issues

  

1.  **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using
only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created
by the application before running the application again.
